## 🔌 API Endpoints

The backend provides various RESTful endpoints for cart management. Detailed API documentation will be added here.

### Testing the API

You can test the API endpoints using either Postman or cURL:

#### Using Postman
1. Open Postman
2. Create a new request
3. Use the following endpoint (replace with your server's IP address):
   ```
   http://<your-server-ip>:3000/api/scan
   ```
   Example: `http://192.168.41.79:3000/api/scan`

#### Using cURL
You can test the endpoints using cURL from your command line:
```bash
curl -X GET http://<your-server-ip>:3000/api/scan
```
Example:
```bash
curl -X GET http://192.168.41.79:3000/api/scan
```

## 🔐 Security

- CORS is enabled for cross-origin requests
- SQLite database for secure data storage
